# 2017 Redbull TV Plugin for Kodi
Streaming video plugin for Kodi that uses the Redbull TV Apple TV v2 XML "API" - it's not really an API, more like an XML web page that gets displayed as-is and then styled with css on Apple TV units. This is when the listing in Kodi will look a bit "odd".

This addon is based on the initial work done by nedge2k: https://github.com/nedge2k/kodi.plugin.video.redbulltv2.
